                    <h2>Hi there! My name is Jamal and welcome to my learning journal.</h2>
                <p>Six months ago, I quite my onsite tedious job, I was aiming to find a remote job. It was overwhelming in early days but later I started enjoying myself in my isolated workspace. It turned out that I am 10x more creative and productive in remote enviornment perhaps the benefits are beyond from my expectations.</p>

            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
    
            <h5>How I got started</h5>
            
            <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                <br>
                <br>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
